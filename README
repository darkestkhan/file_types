There was discussion in #ada about dependent types, and suddenly question came
up: "Is it possible in Ada to define type Open_File, for which the only valid
values are File_Types which are Open?" [i.e.: Is_Open (File) = True].
Turns out yes, it is possible.

"Idea is worth thousand solutions."
This is just an idea of implementation than actual implementation of IO package
but it shows a way in which it can be done.

Further refinements may be needed to make it easier to use.
